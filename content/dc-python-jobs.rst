*This information may eventually live within the DC Python corpus, but for now I prefer to post-it-now-move-it-later.*

DC Python, for those not familiar, is: 

1. A thriving community full of awesome Python programmers in Washington, DC, USA (DC, MD, VA).
#. The name of a Meetup group with over 3,000 members.
#. The name used to refer to our 501(c)(3) organization whose legal name is "ZPUGDC, Inc".

As the President & Executive Director of DC Python (see: #3), I try to be as helpful as possible with all aspects of Python activity in DC (along with many volunteers). **That includes helping Python programmers find jobs and employers find Python programmers.**

Ideally we'd have a professional job board, but that would require a lot of effort from a lot of volunteers. In the meantime, ever since it was suggested by Gloria W from the NYC Python Meetup, we've been using Meetup's message boards to perform a similar function.

This has worked surprisingly well however there *are* some issues. In this post, I will explain how to use DC Python's "Job Board" according to guidelines established by our community.


The `DC Python Job Board <http://www.meetup.com/DCPython/messages/boards/>`_ includes:

- `A board for Python programmers seeking work <http://www.meetup.com/DCPython/messages/boards/forum/13783032>`_.
- `A board for employers seeking Python programmers <http://www.meetup.com/DCPython/messages/boards/forum/617991>`_.
- `A board for organizations & venues willing (or even excited) to host our meetups <http://www.meetup.com/DCPython/messages/boards/forum/13783122>`_.

The #1 function of the board (and biggest consumer of my time spent answering emails) is to serve employers seeking Python programmers. "Employers" *can* and often *does* include professional recruiters.

I've always found it awkward to explain the procedure, but have managed to last several years without documenting it. No more!
