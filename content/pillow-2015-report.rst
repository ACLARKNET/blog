Pillow Fighter #2 Eric Soroos had some time constraints recently so I managed the Pillow 2.8 release. While preparing the release I also reviewed and made improvements to the entire project, including:

- Issues
- Pull Requests
- Documentation
- Website

The state of the Pillow
-----------------------

July of 2015 will mark Pillow's 5th anniversary and as of 2015, PIL is 20 years old. In early 2015, the state of the Pillow is good! Here are some statistics:

- Over 5.5 million PyPI downloads.

  - About 36 distributions uploaded with each release, including Windows Eggs/Exes/Wheels, OS X Wheels and source distributions.

- 4 core developers AKA Pillow Fighters, including the recently added Alexander Karpinsky (AKA 'homm').
- 100 total committers.
- 66 open issues (431 closed).
- 12 open pull requests (672 closed).

Here is more detail on the improvements.

Issues
------

All issues were pruned, including:

- Applying labels and milestones
- Changing state when appropriate
- Asking for status updates

At this time, most if not all issues have at least one label e.g. "bug" and many have milestones configured e.g. "2.9.0". The most meaningful milestones designate either "this release" or "next release" or "future". The most meaningful labels designate "needs code review or tests" or "bug or enhancement" or "question".

Pull Requests
-------------

All mergable pull requests were merged just prior to the 2.8.0 release. Of the remaining open pull requests, most `need code review <https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/labels/Needs%20Code%20Review>`_ and the rest are experimental or in progress.

Documentation
-------------

Pillow's documentation is now sizeable, a large part of which was forked from the PIL handbook and some of which is created automatically by Sphinx. The remainder is new and unique to Pillow and was the focus of the recent cleanup.
