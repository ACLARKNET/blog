Please do my homework

Reminiscent of `this <http://blog.aclark.net/2012/05/23/a-simple-printer-of-nested-lists/>`_, I'm slowly being driven insane by Redditors asking `/r/Python <http://www.reddit.com/r/Python>`_ to do their homework for them.

In principal, and putting aside `/r/learnpython <http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython>`_, I have no problem with Redditors asking /r/Python questions better suited for /r/learnpython.

But there is something about the current proliferation of homework questions on /r/Python that I find offensive.

Perhaps it is due to:

1.) Less meaningful content. I read `/r/Python <http://www.reddit.com/r/Python>`_ for Hacker News-like stories about Python. The more homework questions, the less meaningful content.

2.) No prior meaningful attempt to resolve the issue. E.g. "Ive tried looking online, but to no avail [sic]." What did that attempt look like?
